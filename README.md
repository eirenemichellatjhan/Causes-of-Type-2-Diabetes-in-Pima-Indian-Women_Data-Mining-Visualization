# Causes-of-Type-2-Diabetes-in-Pima-Indian-Women_Data-Mining-Visualization
This project investigates the two main causes of Type 2 diabetes in Pima Indian women: lifestyle habits and genetic predisposition. The goal was to analyze how daily habits and family history influence diabetes risk and provide actionable insights for prevention.

**Tools**: R, dplyr, ggplot2, stats, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Pearson Correlation

**Approach**: Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to summarize statistics, visualize distributions, and identify anomalies. Conducted statistical analysis to examine correlations between lifestyle factors (BMI, SkinThickness) and genetic factors (DiabetesPedigreeFunction) with diabetes outcomes.

**Results**: Analysis showed that individuals with higher BMI and SkinThickness, indicating overweight or obesity, are more likely to develop diabetes, highlighting the critical role of lifestyle. Additionally, a high DiabetesPedigreeFunction indicates a genetic predisposition, meaning that even with a healthy lifestyle, family history can increase diabetes ri

**Key Insight**: Both lifestyle habits and genetic factors contribute to diabetes. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial to reduce risk, but individuals with a family history of diabetes should monitor glucose levels regularly. Early awareness and proactive management can prevent complications and improve overall health outcomes.
